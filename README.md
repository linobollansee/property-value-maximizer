## Business Requirements

Our client has inherited four properties from her late great-grandfather, located in Ames, Iowa, USA. While she has a strong understanding of property prices in her home country, she is concerned that relying on her existing knowledge of the Iowan market may result in inaccurate appraisals. Factors that make a house desirable and valuable in her country may differ from those in Ames, Iowa.

The client has provided a public dataset containing house prices for the Ames area and has requested our assistance in maximizing the sale price for her inherited properties. Our goal is to predict the sale price of these four homes based on their respective attributes.

The business requirements are as follows:

- BR1 - The client wants to understand how various house attributes correlate with the sale price in Ames, Iowa. She expects data visualizations that illustrate the relationships between these variables and the sale price.

- BR2 - The client is looking to predict the sale price for her four inherited houses, as well as for any other property in Ames, Iowa.

To meet these business requirements, Epics and User Stories have been defined. These user stories have been further broken down into manageable tasks, allowing for an agile approach to implementation.

## Hypotheses and Validation

- First Hypothesis: The Relationship Between Property Size and Sale Price
  - Our first hypothesis posits that the size of a property has a direct and positive influence on its sale price. This assumption is grounded in the widely accepted notion that larger properties tend to offer more space and functionality, which in turn, makes them more attractive to potential buyers. The increased square footage of a property typically allows for additional rooms, larger living areas, and greater customization options, all of which are desirable attributes in a real estate market. Consequently, it is expected that properties with greater size will command higher sale prices due to their enhanced utility and appeal.
    - Hypothesis Confirmation: Following a rigorous correlation analysis of the dataset, we observed a positive and moderate correlation between the size-related features of the properties and their sale prices. This finding validates our hypothesis, as it indicates that larger properties indeed tend to sell for higher prices. The data clearly supports the notion that, all other factors being equal, the size of a property plays a significant role in determining its market value, confirming our initial assumption.

- Second Hypothesis: The Impact of Overall Quality on Sale Price
  - Our second hypothesis focuses on the role of a property's overall quality in influencing its sale price. We hypothesize that properties with higher quality ratings, which reflect superior materials, craftsmanship, and design, will be priced higher in the market. Buyers are likely to place a premium on well-constructed homes that offer longevity, comfort, and aesthetic appeal, which in turn boosts their market value. As such, homes with higher quality ratings should be more desirable and consequently demand higher prices.
    - Hypothesis Confirmation: After analyzing the data, we confirmed that there is a strong correlation between a property's overall quality rating and its sale price. Homes that received higher quality ratings were consistently priced higher in the market, reinforcing the idea that construction quality plays a pivotal role in determining a propertyâ€™s value. This analysis supports our hypothesis that factors such as the quality of materials, craftsmanship, and overall design are crucial in shaping buyer perceptions and influencing the final sale price.

- Third Hypothesis: The Influence of Property Condition on Market Value
  - For our third hypothesis, we investigate how a property's condition affects its sale price. We hypothesize that homes in excellent condition, particularly those that have undergone recent renovations or are newly built, will be more desirable to buyers and therefore will command higher sale prices. The condition of a property often reflects its upkeep and can signal to buyers the level of maintenance and care invested in the home. Properties in better condition are generally perceived as more move-in ready, which makes them more attractive to prospective buyers looking for immediate comfort without the need for costly repairs or improvements.
    - Hypothesis Confirmation: Our analysis supports this hypothesis by revealing a positive and moderate correlation between sale price and key factors such as the property's construction year and the year of its last remodel. The data suggests that newer homes and those with recent upgrades tend to sell at higher prices, highlighting the importance of property condition in the pricing process. The findings confirm that well-maintained homes or those with modern features are more likely to achieve higher sale prices, underscoring the influence of condition on market value.

## Mapping Business Requirements to Data Visualizations and ML Tasks

- **Business Requirement 1: Data Visualization & Correlation Analysis**
  - Conduct a correlation study using Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients to assess the relationship between house attributes and the target variable, house price.
  - Evaluate the significance of these correlations.
  - Visualize key variables against house prices to gain insights into their impact.
  - This analysis is documented in the following notebook: <https://github.com/linobollansee/property-value-maximizer/blob/main/jupyter_notebooks/03%20-%20CorrelationStudy.ipynb>

- **Business Requirement 2: Regression Analysis for Price Prediction**
  - Since house price is a continuous variable, a regression analysis is performed to build a predictive model.
  - If regression models do not meet performance expectations, classification-based approaches may be explored.
  - The goal is to predict house prices using key features: `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, `GarageArea`, `YearBuilt`, `TotalBsmtSF`
  - This analysis is detailed in the following notebook: <https://github.com/linobollansee/property-value-maximizer/blob/main/jupyter_notebooks/05%20-%20MLModelEvaluation.ipynb>
  
## Business Case Understanding

- Clientâ€™s Business Requirements

  - The client requires a comprehensive analysis to understand the correlation between various house attributes and their corresponding sale prices. They expect visualizations that clearly display the features most strongly correlated with the sale price, allowing for more informed decision-making.

  - In addition to this, the client has inherited four houses and seeks a predictive model to estimate their sale prices. The client also intends to extend the model to predict sale prices for other properties in Ames, Iowa.

- Traditional Data Analysis Feasibility:

  - The client could use traditional analysis methods to approximate the sale prices of the inherited houses by comparing them with similar properties in the dataset. However, this approach is prone to errors due to its subjective nature and reliance on general assumptions. Such estimates are not precise and may lead to inaccuracies in decision-making.

- Dashboard vs. API:

  - The client specifically requires a dashboard. This dashboard will provide an interactive way to visualize data, explore correlations, and predict sale prices in real-time. An API is not necessary for the clientâ€™s use case.

- Success Criteria for the Client:

  - A successful outcome for the client is defined by delivering an in-depth analysis that reveals the key attributes most strongly correlated with house sale prices. This will guide the client in maximizing the sale prices of their inherited properties.

- Ethical and Privacy Considerations:

  - The dataset used for this project is publicly available, eliminating any ethical or privacy concerns associated with its use.

- Agile Implementation: EPICS and User Stories:

  - EPICS have been defined for clear guidance, and user stories are tracked through GitHub issues on a Kanban board, which facilitates agile project management. This ensures effective tracking and smooth collaboration throughout the project lifecycle.

  - The project board can be found here: [GitHub Project Board]

- Given that the task involves predicting a continuous numeric outcome, a regression model is the most appropriate for this scenario. This model will leverage the relationships between house features and sale price to make accurate predictions.

- Project Inputs and Expected Outputs:

  - Inputs: The house attributes derived from the publicly available dataset.
  - Outputs: The predicted sale price for each house, expressed in USD as a continuous numeric value.
  - The model will be used to predict the sale price of each of the four inherited houses based on their respective attributes. Additionally, a combined prediction of the total sale price for all four houses will be generated.
  - A user interacting with the dashboard will be able to input the attributes of any house (excluding the inherited ones) through input widgets and receive an estimated sale price instantly.

- Definition of Success:

  - Success will be achieved if the model achieves an RÂ² score of at least 0.75 on both the training and test datasets. This threshold will indicate that the model is sufficiently accurate and reliable.

- Client Benefits:

  - By utilizing this predictive model, the client will be able to optimize the sale prices for their inherited properties. The model will provide accurate, data-driven price predictions, empowering the client to make informed decisions that maximize the sale value of each house.

## Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning Pipeline

A data cleaning pipeline was developed to handle missing values. Various imputation methods were applied based on the statistical properties of the variables.

- Mean Imputation for Normally Distributed Continuous Variables
  - For continuous features such as `LotFrontage` and `BedroomAbvGr`, missing values were imputed using the mean. This approach is suitable for variables that follow an approximately normal distribution without significant outliers, as it maintains the overall data distribution without skewing the central tendency.

- Median Imputation for Skewed Continuous Variables
  - Variables exhibiting right-skewed distributions, such as `2ndFlrSF` and `MasVnrArea`, were imputed using the median. Since the median is less sensitive to extreme values, it provides a more robust imputation strategy for skewed data, preventing artificial distortion of the dataset.

- Categorical Variable Imputation with 'None'
  - Categorical features like `GarageFinish`, `BsmtFinType1`, and `BsmtExposure` were missing primarily because these attributes did not apply to certain properties (e.g., a house without a basement). To preserve this structural information, missing values were imputed with "None" rather than the mode, ensuring that the absence of a feature is explicitly represented rather than inferred as a common category.

- Feature Removal Due to High Missingness
  - Features such as `EnclosedPorch`, `GarageYrBlt`, and `WoodDeckSF` contained a substantial proportion of missing values. Rather than imputing them with limited available observations which could introduce bias, these features were removed from the dataset. Their exclusion was justified based on their potential lack of predictive power and the risk of introducing noise into the model.

For imputation rationale, refer to the detailed analysis in the following notebook: <https://github.com/linobollansee/property-value-maximizer/blob/main/jupyter_notebooks/02%20-%20DataCleaning.ipynb>

### Feature Engineering

#### Categorical encoding
Categorical encoding was applied to convert ordinal categories into numerical values, preserving both the order and hierarchy of the categories. This allowed the regression analysis to account for their relative rankings. However, during the data cleaning process, most ordinal categories were removed.  

#### Numerical Transformations

|**Feature**|**Assessment**|**Applied Transformation**|
|----|----|----|
|TotalBsmtSF| Mean imputation proved to be the most effective method for handling missing values.|MeanMedianImputer|
|GrLivArea| A logarithmic transformation was the best approach to achieve normalization.|LogTransformer|
|TotalBsmtSF| Power transformation yielded the most effective normalization.|PowerTransformer|
|TotalBsmtSF, GarageArea| Outliers were best handled using Winsorization with the IQR method.|Winsorizer|
|TotalBsmtSF, GrLivArea, GarageArea|Standard scaling provided the most effective way to normalize feature ranges.|StandardScaler|
